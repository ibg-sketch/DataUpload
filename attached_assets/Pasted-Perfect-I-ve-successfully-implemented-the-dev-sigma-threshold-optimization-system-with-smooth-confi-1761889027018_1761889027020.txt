Perfect! I've successfully implemented the dev_sigma threshold optimization system with smooth confidence boosting. Here's what's been completed:

✅ Implementation Summary
1. Smooth Confidence Boost Formula (Replaces Binary 15% Boost)
New Formula: boost = max(0.0, min(0.20, (dev_sigma - 1.0) / 3.0))
Behavior:
dev_sigma ≤ 1.0: 0% boost (no enhancement)
dev_sigma = 1.5: 16.7% boost (gradual increase)
dev_sigma ≥ 2.0: 20% boost (maximum, capped)
Applied to: Both BUY and SELL signals in smart_signal.py
2. Per-Symbol Threshold Configuration (A/B/C System)
All 11 symbols now have customizable thresholds in config.yaml:

dev_sigma_thresholds:
  block_below: 0.30  # Block weak signals (Set B default)
  boost_above: 2.00  # Boost extreme deviations (Set B default)

Three optimization sets available:

Set A: Conservative (block: 0.25, boost: 1.8)
Set B: Balanced (block: 0.30, boost: 2.0) ← Current default
Set C: Aggressive (block: 0.40, boost: 2.2)
3. Comprehensive Tracking (3 New CSV Fields)
analysis_log.csv now logs:

dev_sigma_blocked: (1/0) - Was signal blocked by low deviation?
dev_sigma_boost: (0.0-0.20) - How much confidence boost was applied?
ab_set_used: (A/B/C_default) - Which threshold set was used?
4. Backtest Script (backtest_dev_sigma.py)
Ready to auto-tune thresholds after 30+ days of data collection:

python backtest_dev_sigma.py

Will analyze all 3 threshold sets per symbol and select the best based on:

Primary metric: profit_factor (reward-to-risk ratio)
Secondary metric: win_rate (accuracy)
📊 Current Status
Bot is running and collecting dev_sigma data with:

✅ Smooth boost formula active (0-20% gradual)
✅ All symbols initialized with Set B defaults
✅ Comprehensive logging enabled
✅ Fresh analysis_log.csv with new schema
Sample log data:

dev_sigma  dev_sigma_blocked  dev_sigma_boost  ab_set_used
1.48       0                  0.0              B_default
1.72       0                  0.0              B_default

(Note: boost shows 0.0 for NO_TRADE verdicts - will show actual values when BUY/SELL signals are generated)

🚀 Next Steps
After 30+ days of data collection:

Run: python backtest_dev_sigma.py
Review the optimization results
Update config.yaml with recommended thresholds per symbol
Restart the bot to apply optimized settings
The system is now continuously collecting data to enable evidence-based threshold optimization, moving from the current universal defaults to asset-specific settings that maximize profitability for each symbol.
