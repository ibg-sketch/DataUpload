🔍 CRITICAL INSIGHTS - UPDATED
================================================================================

1. ✅ **MODERATE CVD WINS**: 
   - LINKUSDT winners: -200K to -241K (moderate selling)
   - SOLUSDT winner: -6.6M (stronger but not extreme)
   - ETHUSDT losers: -5M to -22M (EXTREME selling)
   
   Pattern: Moderate selling pressure works, extreme panic fails

2. ⚠️ **RSI SWEET SPOT = 44-55 (Neutral)**:
   - Winners: RSI 43.8 to 55.4 (not overbought)
   - Losers: RSI 68-72 (very overbought)
   
   Pattern: Overbought conditions FAIL, neutral/weak conditions WIN

3. 🎯 **STAY CLOSE TO VWAP**:
   - Winners: +0.08% to +0.89% above VWAP (near fair value)
   - Losers: +0.78% to +1.56% above VWAP (extended)
   
   Pattern: Selling near fair value works, chasing extensions fails

4. 💪 **BASELINE MARKET STRENGTH WINS**:
   - Winners: 1.0x to 1.4x (baseline to moderate)
   - Losers: 1.38x to 1.61x (elevated)
   
   Pattern: Normal conditions win, extreme conditions lose

5. 📊 **SYMBOL BEHAVIOR**:
   - LINKUSDT: Wins with low CVD (-200K), moderate conditions
   - SOLUSDT: Wins with higher CVD (-6.6M) but still moderate RSI (43.8)
   - ETHUSDT: Loses even with extreme signals
   
   Pattern: Each symbol has different thresholds

6. ⏱ **DURATION**:
   - Winners: 25-33 min (consistent range)
   - Losers: 16-21 min (shorter, rushed)
   
   Pattern: Slightly longer durations give moves time to develop


================================================================================
🚀 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Based on 3 winners vs 3 losers (n=6):

1. **CVD Thresholds by Symbol:**
   - LINKUSDT: Optimal CVD = -150K to -500K (moderate)
   - SOLUSDT: Optimal CVD = -5M to -10M (stronger but not extreme)
   - ETHUSDT: AVOID CVD < -15M (too extreme, signals panic)

2. **RSI Filter:**
   - For SELL signals, ONLY enter when RSI < 60
   - IDEAL RANGE: RSI 40-55 (neutral/slightly weak)
   - REJECT: RSI > 70 (overbought, likely to bounce)

3. **VWAP Positioning:**
   - Enter SELLS when price is +0.0% to +1.0% above VWAP
   - AVOID: Price > +1.5% above VWAP (too extended)

4. **Market Strength Cap:**
   - MAXIMUM: 1.5x market strength
   - OPTIMAL: 1.0x to 1.3x (baseline to moderate)

5. **Symbol-Specific Approach:**
   - LINKUSDT: Works well, keep current weights
   - SOLUSDT: Works with moderate settings
   - ETHUSDT: PAUSE or reduce weight significantly

6. **Minimum Duration:**
   - Set minimum TTL to 25 minutes
   - Avoid signals with < 20 minute duration
