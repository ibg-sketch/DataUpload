🔍 KEY INSIGHTS - CANCELLED SIGNALS
================================================================================

1. ⚠️ **BNBUSDT CANCELLED - Moderate Setup (Similar to Winners)**:
   - RSI: 54.20 (✅ Neutral, like winners)
   - Price vs VWAP: +0.93% (✅ Moderate extension)
   - CVD: -3M (⚠️ Higher than LINK winners -200K, but less than ETH losers -14M)
   - Liq Ratio: 3.43 (✅ Good, shorts liquidating)
   - OI Change: -0.03% (✅ Slight decline)
   
   WHY CANCELLED? Likely lost 3/4 confluence soon after signal generation.
   This was a BORDERLINE signal - moderate indicators could go either way.

2. 🚨 **SOLUSDT CANCELLED - RED FLAGS (System Caught It!)**:
   - Price: 189.98 vs VWAP: 190.10 → BELOW VWAP for a SELL signal! ❌
   - OI Change: +0.02% → OI INCREASED instead of decreased! ❌
   - CVD: -18.5M → EXTREME selling pressure ❌
   - High Confidence: 81% → High confidence on wrong setup ❌
   
   WHY CANCELLED? Price below VWAP + OI increasing = conflicting signals!
   System correctly identified this as invalid setup and cancelled it.

3. 📊 **SOLUSDT at 17:50 WON, 17:55 CANCELLED - What Changed?**
   
   17:50 WINNER:
   - Price: 190.27 | VWAP: 190.11 → +0.08% ABOVE VWAP ✅
   - CVD: -6.6M (moderate for SOL)
   - OI Change: ~0% (stable)
   - RSI: 43.8
   
   17:55 CANCELLED (5 mins later):
   - Price: 189.98 | VWAP: 190.10 → -0.06% BELOW VWAP ❌
   - CVD: -18.5M (EXTREME, nearly 3x worse!)
   - OI Change: +0.02% (wrong direction!)
   - RSI: 42.3
   
   In just 5 minutes, price crossed BELOW VWAP and CVD became EXTREME!
   This invalidated the SELL setup → correct cancellation.

4. 📈 **Symbol Performance Context**:
   - LINKUSDT: 50% win rate (Good performer, winners show this)
   - BNBUSDT: 24% win rate (Poor performer, cancelled was right call)
   - SOLUSDT: 18% win rate (Worst performer, 17:50 win is rare, 17:55 correctly rejected)
   - ETHUSDT: 18% win rate (All losers in sample are ETHUSDT)


================================================================================
✅ VALIDATION OF CANCELLATION LOGIC
================================================================================

The system's cancellation mechanism is working CORRECTLY:

✅ **BNBUSDT Cancellation:**
   - Moderate setup (not extreme)
   - Lost confluence shortly after generation
   - BNB has 24% win rate, so avoiding borderline signals is smart

✅ **SOLUSDT Cancellation:**
   - Price BELOW VWAP for a SELL (contradictory positioning)
   - OI INCREASED instead of decreased (wrong trend)
   - Extreme CVD (-18.5M vs -6.6M for winner 5 min earlier)
   - These are clear red flags that invalidate the setup

🎯 **Pattern Confirmation:**
   Winners: Moderate indicators, proper positioning vs VWAP, OI in right direction
   Losers: Extreme indicators, overbought RSI, extended from VWAP
   Cancelled: Either lost confluence OR had contradictory signals

The cancellation system is PROTECTING you from bad trades!

🚀 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS - UPDATED
================================================================================

Based on Winners (3), Losers (3), Cancelled (2):

1. **VWAP Positioning is CRITICAL:**
   - For SELL signals, price MUST be ABOVE VWAP
   - Reject if price < VWAP (like cancelled SOLUSDT)
   - Winners: +0.08% to +0.89% above VWAP
   - Losers: +0.78% to +1.56% above VWAP
   - OPTIMAL: +0.0% to +1.0% above VWAP for SELL

2. **OI Direction Matters:**
   - For SELL signals, OI should decline or stay flat
   - Reject if OI increases (like cancelled SOLUSDT +0.02%)
   - Winners: -0.02% to 0.0% (flat/slight decline)
   - Losers: -0.02% to -0.30% (varied)

3. **CVD Thresholds by Symbol:**
   - LINKUSDT: -150K to -500K (winners were in this range)
   - SOLUSDT: -5M to -10M (winner was -6.6M, cancelled was -18.5M)
   - BNBUSDT: < -3M might be too aggressive
   - ETHUSDT: Avoid CVD < -15M (all extreme CVD failed)

4. **RSI Filter (CRITICAL):**
   - Winners: RSI 43.8-55.4 (neutral zone)
   - Losers: RSI 68.3-72.5 (overbought)
   - REJECT SELL when RSI > 65

5. **Symbol-Specific Weight Adjustment:**
   - LINKUSDT: Keep current weights (50% win rate)
   - BNBUSDT: Reduce weights or increase thresholds (24% win rate)
   - SOLUSDT: Tighten CVD limits (18% win rate)
   - ETHUSDT: Significantly reduce or pause (18% win rate)

6. **Confluence Validation:**
   - Current system correctly cancels when positioning is wrong
   - Strengthen VWAP positioning rules (price vs VWAP for direction)
   - Strengthen OI direction validation
